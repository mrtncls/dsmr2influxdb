# DSMR2InfluxDB

Read telemetry data (DSMR format) from the Fluvius smart digital meter's P1 port and forward to InfluxDB.
This project uses an ESP32 with micropython firmware.

# Commissioning

[Install micropython](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)

Use a tool like [EsPy](https://github.com/jungervin/EsPy/tree/master/EsPy/Release) or [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) to copy the python files onto the ESP32.

# Hardware

 - ESP32
 - RJ11 (6P) plug and wire
 - 1000 Ohm resistor

Connect CTS (Pin 2) of the meter to 3v3 on the ESP32  
Connect signal ground (Pin 3) to ESP32 ground  
Connect RX (Pin 5) of the meter to pin13 on the ESP32 and connect the resistor between this pin and 3v3 (to pull-up the inverted data signal)  
Connect GND (Pin 6) to ground on ESP32  
~~Connect 5V (Pin 1) to 5V on ESP32~~ (not enough power to feed the ESP32)
